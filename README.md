Chrome plugin 

This is just a simple chrome plugin that can perform basic editing actions like highlight, bolden, italisize and so on 

To test it 
1) fork the repository
2) go to chrome://extensions/  and load unpacked
3) choose the folder you just forked(do not forgrt to unzip)
4) you will see a tiny grey icon at the top right hand corner
5) after doing the above to see its functions go to https://developer.chrome.com/home . the grey icon will now be coloured
6) Use your cursor to highlight something and click the extension icon and perform your function

cheers :)
